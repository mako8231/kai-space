## Frontend Revamping

Make a whole new brand frontend code, with a better design, mockuping.

## Planned content:

<hr/>

### Accounts:

Every account can be registered prompting their e-mail and password (along with confirmation), the **`Administrator`** account will be generated by **`.env`**. The admin account can edit the roles of already signed members, promoting (or demoting) them to the role of **`Moderator`**.

As for the regular registring members, while their **`Account`** is created, a new user **`Profile`** is created automatically.

The **Account registration** can be made by `e-mail` confirmation, this feature will be implemented later on.

<hr/>

### Profiles:

The **`Profile`** is created automatically as long the registration is complete. And the information will be publicly visible, as `Nickname`, `art-posts`, `forum-categories`, etc.

<hr/>

### Threads:

The forum supports two differents types of threads: **`discussion threads`** and **`art threads`**. Those posts are their own very thing:

**Discussion Threads:**

- **Categories:** The categories are made by the **`Administrator`** role itself, and those categories will have their pinned **`category rule`**. The contents of threads can be moderated by the **`Administrator`** or other forum's **`moderators`**.

<hr/>

**Art Thread:** It has a picture gallery in each post, the info about the author, related tags about the image, post score (which is just a like count, no dislikes), and artist's related work.

Every **Art Thread** belongs with a single category.
